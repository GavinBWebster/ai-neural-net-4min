# ai-neural-net-4min

Build a Neural Net in 4 Minutes (python 3 working edition)

## Intro

This is the working code (debugged for Python 3) for the video "Make a Neural Network in 4 minutes" by Siraj Raval on Youtube found [here.](https://youtu.be/h3l4qz76JhQ)

##Overview

There were a few bugs, mainly syntax issues, with the original code that stopped it from working with Python 3. This code fixes those problems. 

##Dependencies

Just Numpy, import numpy as np

##Usage

Run python demo.py in terminal to see it train, then predict.

##Credits

Credits go to [Siraj Raval](https://github.com/llSourcell) & anybody else who contributed to the original code. I've merely fixed the bugs people were complaining about in the comments section so that users have working code for Python 3.

NB I used Python version 3.7.1 + Sublime Text 3 version 3.2.1, Build 3207, at the time of this update/commit.
